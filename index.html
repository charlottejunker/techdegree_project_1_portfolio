      <h1 class="tag name">Hello, I’m Charlotte.</h1>
      <p class="tag location">My home is London. I love the countryside too. I'm just as happy knitting a scarf as getting lost in the internet: I like that my life is equally low tech and high tech.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm an English teacher in an inner-London secondary school. I tried to learn to code from a book (!) ten years ago and then joined Treehouse last year.<p>
        <p>I joined the Techdegree to focus my attention on coding a little more, so I can build my skills. I'm not sure where I'm going with it but I'm enjoying learning more about web development.</p>
        <p>At school I run a girls' coding club, using Codecademy. The students are learning the languages they want and I am there to support and champion, rather than teach. We are learning together. I started the club because the stats on women in tech are worrying. And even though the girls say they feel they can do anything they want, the uptake of extra-curricular opportunities, course and mixed-gender clubs is low in our school. Girls still don't seem to think computer science is 'for them'. They do enjoy the club and it forces the issue a bit. I hope it won't be neccessary in a few years.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>

        <p>To recap and improve my skills in writing: </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To learn how to write:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I’d like to keep my options open. Combining education and web development might be a possibility in the future.</p>
